# Customer Rewards

This Spring Boot application calculates reward points for customers based on their transactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Business Logic

Customers earn reward points as follows:
- 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 up to $100.
- 2 points for every dollar spent over $100.

**Example**:  
A purchase of $120 earns:  
- 2 Ã— ($120 - $100) = 40 points  
- 1 Ã— ($100 - $50) = 50 points  
- **Total = 90 points**

## Features
- Calculates 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 up to $100
- Calculates 2 points for every dollar spent over $100
- Calculates rewards per month and total for a selected timeframe
- Asynchronous API call
- Exception handling and input validation
